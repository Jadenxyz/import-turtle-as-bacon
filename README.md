# import-turtle-as-bacon
Sorry. The turtle version isn't working out (the original that is on my replit account Jaden-Lin-Yu-Xi (there is also an fixed version on my replit account)), so please use this version. 

A simple Python program. Beautifully built to the utmost. Welcome, to the world of bacon.

While bacon just tells you only a few words, simple is the best.
He talks to you in the description of this repo.
Bacon: aw come on dev im still a raw bacon ok
He crys. He laughs. He talks to you anytime.
Bacon: oh yea i drive a car over your head
He tells you about unmistakably bacon words.
Thanks for using bacon.
Bacon: do i have to talk to everybody bro cmon dev
